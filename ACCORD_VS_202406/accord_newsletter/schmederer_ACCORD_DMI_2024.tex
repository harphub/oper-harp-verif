\section{Introduction}
\sectionrule
A Visiting scientist (VS) from GeoSphere (Polly Schmederer) visited DMI during June 2024. The VS 
was funded by the ACCORD-VS program, as part of the MQA working package. The VS was hosted by Fabrizio Baordo
and Carlos Peralta at the DMI headquarters in Copenhagen. The 4 weeks stay was focused on the 
implementation  of new capabilities of the \panels tool \cite{panel_tool} developed at GeoSphere to include additional scores and variables. 
Additionally, the use of the \retis package \cite{reticulate}, that provides an interface to the python language from the R language, was also considered.

The software development is shared in a github repository that includes installation instructions and example data sets \cite{repo}.
Details of the codea are presented below, along with application examples and future work.

%Generalising spatial verifications: 
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item improving R scripting in 
%    \item use of the \retis package to interface R with Python;
%    \item generalise/apply the \panels tool
%    \item providing examples.
%\end{itemize}

\section{Methods and software used}
The \harps package is a framework for meteorological data developed by Andrew Singleton (Met Norway) and Alex Decknym (RMS) \cite{harp}.
It is currently the official model verification tool in the ACCORD consortium.
The \panels tool is a visualization framework developed at GeoSphere in order to display summarized views of spatial verification scores
produced by the \harpss part of the \harps package \cite{panel_tool}.
The developments during the VS included the extension of new variables in the panel tool and the inclusion of the \retis package in the 
tool chain. 
The \retis package provides an interface between R and the Python language.
This allowed us to easily include some of the vast functionalities available
in Python, for example through the library \texttt{xarray}. This facilitated
the reading and regridding of the input data from satellite (nat format)
and model data from different sources in grib and netcdf format.
%This facilitated the ingestion of new data types in netcdf and grib format.

The general aims of the visit were the following.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrate the \panels tool in the \harps library.
    \item Use of the \retis package to interface R with Python;
    \item Generalise/apply the \panels tool to different applications
    \item Providing examples.
\end{itemize}

All the developments were carried out in a branch of the \texttt{oper-harp-verif} repository \cite{oper-harp}.
The \texttt{renv} package was used to create a local R environment where all
the necessary libraries and dependencies can be installed.

\section{Developments in the \panels too and \harpss}

%\sectionrule
%\subsection{Reading functions}

A detailed description of the functions can be found in the \texttt{README.md} file
in the github repository. 
The main developments included
\begin{itemize}
\item New functions to interface Python with R through the \retis package.
\item Including the new parameters in the \panels tool.
\item Configuration files for each example presented in the repository, along with
instructions on how to add new parameters
\item New functions to display the information in the \panels tool
\item Example files to test the application.
\item Instruction on how to install the \harps and \panels packages along with
 all their dependencies using the \renvs (currently only for the hpc cluster at ECMWF).
\end{itemize}
%The functions inside $reading_functions.R$ contains the following reading functions.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $$read_msg_reticulate$$  Python function that reads/ regrids the data and converts the returned data into a harp data frame.
%\item $$read_nc_reticulate$$ calls python function that reads snow data and converts the returned data into a harp data frame.
%\item $$reading_functions.py$$ Contains the python functions that are called by R to read / regrid satellite observations ( in .nat format ) and model data (.grib).
%\item $$sat_model_to_same_grid$$ reads/ regrids satellite data.
%\item $$get_data_nc_file()$$ reads regridded snow data in nc format.
%\end{itemize}

\section{Data used for spatial verification}
The following observation data was use in the examples provided in the repository.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Radar precipitation product from the DMI: Surface Quantitative Precipitation
Estimation (SQPE) using both rain gauge and radar data.

\item EUMETSAT SEVIRI data \cite{seviri}: High Rate SEVIRI
Level 1.5 Image Data - MSG - 0 degree (native), e.g. MSG3-SEVI-
MSG15-0100-NA-20240102235743.693000000Z-NA.nat
\item Cryo clim data
\end{enumerate}

The following model data was used.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Grib files output of the DEODE workflow running HARMONIE cy46h1 (total
precipitation and FULL POS simulated radiances channels WV 062 and IR 08).
\item CARRA data from the Copernicus Data Service

\end{enumerate}

%As part of the WP6 of the CERISE (Copernicus Climate Change Service
%Evolution) project, DMI is contributing to the spatial verification of snow cover
%using the harp verification package. There is a website for the project, if you
%to add in the README: https://cerise-project.eu/.

%The headings of main sections are underlined. This is achieved by the new command "sectionrule".


%An example of a Table is given in \ref{tab:grib}. Please feel free to make a more fancy one if you like.
A list of the different types of input data used in the examples can be found in table \ref{tab:grib}. %Please feel free to make a more fancy one if you like.

%\subsection{Figure layout}
%Figures have to be provided in high resolution, preferably in Encapulated PostScript (eps) format, or ".png", ".jpg" or ".gif". 
%\textbf{Please, NO .PS files (PDFLaTeX cannot use .ps image files to produce a .pdf file).}
%In principle it is best to provide me seperately the image files that are closest to the creating source and have not yet been converted into another format.
%
%The picture caption is placed under the picture, in italic, for example see Figure \ref{fig:O3}.
%
%Please be careful with the size of your picture. LibreOffice has tools to reduce the size of the .pdf file created from your article (with reducing the definition of the pictures). It's not the case with latex (or I don't know how to do that), thus the pictures you provide should have reasonable size.
