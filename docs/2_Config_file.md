# Create your config file

Create a configuration file for your project using the structure provided in the example configs. The config file is split into options used for pre-processing (`pre`), verification (`verif`), visualisation/output (`post`), and scorecards (`scorecards`). A description of these options is given below. Note that paths specified should already exist on your system as the scripts typically do not assume permission to generate parent directories.

| Type | Option name | Description | Example (s)   |
| ---  | --- | --- | --- |   
| verif | project_name | A descriptive name for the verification project. This is the same as the the project name variable PROJECT in monitor’s configuration file scr/Env_exp. | project_name: "TEST" |
| verif | fcst_model   | The names of the forecast models to consider. | fcst_model: <br> - model_A  <br> - model_B |
| verif | lead_time    | Lead times to consider in the verification e.g. 0 to 48 in steps of 3 hours. `seq` and `c()` will be parsed and evaluated by R. | lead_time: seq(0,48,3) | 
| verif | by_step      | Interval (in hours) between cycles to be used for verification i.e. cycles considered are `start_date` to `end_date` in steps of `verif:by_step`. | by_step: "6h" |
| verif | fcst_type    | Forecast type, either `det` or `eps`. | fcst_type: "det" |
| verif | domains      | What SID lists to verify (equivalent to SURFSELECTION/TEMPSELECTION in monitor, where the station lists are defined in scr/selection.pm). The choice "All" will use all stations available in the data. SID lists, either defined explicitly or based on a geographic area, can be defined in `fn_station_selection` (see the documentation below for more information). | domains: <br> -"All" <br> <br> domains: <br> - "IRL" <br> - "IE_EN" | 
| verif | members      | What ensemble members to use in the verification for each `verif:fcst_model`. Set to NULL to use all the members available in each ensemble. Include a list here if the members to be used differ for each of the `verif:fcst_model`. | For a deterministic model or to read all memeber in an ensemble: <br> members: <br> - NULL <br> <br> Specific members from different ensembles: <br> members: <br> - c(1,2,3) <br> - c(4,5,6) |
| verif | lags         | How to lag the ensemble members for each ensemble. Include a list if the lags differ for each of the `verif:fcst_model`. Set to “0h” for no lagging. The parent cycles for lagging are determined by the `start date`, `end date`, and `verif:by_step`. See `harpIO::read_point_forecast` for more information. | For a deterministic model: <br> lags: <br> - "0h" <br> <br> For 3hr lagging in the first ensemble, no lagging in the second: <br> lags: <br> - c("0h","3h") <br> - "0h" |
| verif | num_ref_members | Number of reference members to use when computing fair scores for an ensemble (e.g. "Inf"). Not used for deterministic models. See `harpPoint::ens_verify` for more details. | num_ref_memebrs: "Inf" |
| verif | ua_fcst_cycle | For upper air variables, do you want to group by fcst_cycle? Either TRUE or FALSE | ua_fcst_cycle: FALSE |
| verif | force_valid_thr | Set to TRUE if you really want threshold scores over valid times/hours. FALSE is generally sufficient. | force_valid_thr: FALSE |
| verif | models_to_scale | Use this to specify if the forecast scaling (i.e. parameter `scale_fcst` in `set_params.R`) should only be applied to certain models. This is useful if models have different units, for example. NULL will apply the same scaling to all models (if `scale_fcst` is found). | models_to_scale: <br> - NULL |
| verif | fcst_path    | Path to the forecast sqlite tables generated from the vfld. | fcst_path: "/path/to/FCTABLE" |
| verif | obs_path     | Path to the observation sqlite tables generated from the vobs. | obs_path: "/path/to/OBSTBALE" |
| verif | verif_path   | A root directory where the rds verification files are stored. For a given project, these rds files will be located in `verif:verif_path`/`verif:project_name`. | verif_path: "/path/to/rds" |
| pre   | fcst_model   | Carry out the vfld to sqlite conversion for these forecast models. Note that this can differ from `verif:fcst_model` (e.g. the sqlite tables may already exist for some models, and you may want to skip regenerating these). | fcst_model: <br> - model_A  <br> - model_B | 
| pre   | lead_time    | Which lead times to use when converting the vfld. Can differ from `verif:lead_time`. | lead_time: seq(0,48,1) |
| pre   | vfld_path    | Path to where the vfld files are stored (note that the full file names to be read are constructed from `pre:vfld_path` and `pre:vfld_template`). The vfld files for each `pre:fcst_model` should exist in this directory. | vfld_path: "/path/to/vfld" |
| pre   | vfld_by      | Interval (in hours) between cycles to be used when generating the sqlite tables from vfld i.e. read vfld files from `start_date` to `end_date` in steps of `pre:vfld_by`. This can differ from `verif:by_step`. | vfld_by: "3h" |
| pre   | vfld_template | The template used to construct the vfld file names. See `harpIO::show_file_templates`. For deterministic/ensemble experiments, the standard choices are “vfld” and "vfld_eps". If different templates are to be used for different forecast models, then include a `pre:vfld_template` entry corresponding to each forecast model. Custom templates can also be created. | Standard: <br> vfld_template: <br> - "det" <br> <br> Custom: <br> vfld_template: <br> - "{fcst_model}/{YYYY}/{MM}/vfld{fcst_model}{YYYY}{MM}{DD}{HH}{LDT2}" | 
| pre   | vobs_path    | Path to where the vobs files are stored. | vobs_path: "/path/to/vobs" |
| pre   | vobs_by      | Interval (in hours) between the vobs files i.e. read vobs files from `start_date` to `end_date` in steps of `pre:vobs_by`. | vobs_by: "1h" | 
| pre   | custom_asl_path | Path to a specific HARMONIE-AROME allsynop.list to use when converting the vfld data. If not specified, harp's default stationlist is used (`harpCore::station_list`). | custom_asl_path: "/path/to/allsynop.list" | 
| pre   | members      | Which members to read for each ensemble. If only one option is set for members, it will be repeated for each `pre:fcst_model`. Set to NULL for a deterministic experiment. Note: this variable is different from `verif:members` as the two can differ in general. | For deterministic models: <br> members: <br> - NULL <br> <br> For ensembles: <br> - seq(0,6) |
| pre   | lags         | How the ensemble members are lagged for each `pre:fcst_model`. For a given model, `pre:lags` should be the same length as `pre:members`. Include a list if the lags differ for each of the `pre:fcst_model`. Note: this variable is different from `verif:lags` as the notation used for each is different. | For deterministic models: <br> lags: <br> - NULL <br> <br> For ensemble models: <br> lags: <br> - c(0,0,0,0,3,3,3) | 
| pre   | params       | Which parameters to consider when generating the sqlite tables from vfld. See `harpIO::show_harp_parameters` and `harpIO::harp_params` for recognised vfld parameters in harp. Set to NULL to convert everything found. | params: <br> - T2m <br> - Td2m <br> - T <br> <br> To convert everything found in the vfld: <br> params: <br> - NULL |
| post  | plot_output | A root directory indicating where to save the png files generated during the verification process. For a given project, the png files will be stored in `post:plot_output`/`verif:project_name`. Set to "default" to use `verif:verif_path`/archive. | plot_output: "/path/to/png" |
| post  | create_png  | Flag to indicate if png files should be generated. | create_png: TRUE | 
| post  | cmap        | What palette to use for the line plots. Choose from a palette in RColorBrewer or "trubetskoy". Defaults to "Set2" if not specified | cmap: "trubetskoy" | 
| scorecards | create_scrd | Logical switch to produce scorecard data, save the data, and plot the scorecard. | create_scrd: TRUE | 
| scorecards | ref_model   | The reference model for the scorecards. | ref_model: "old_model" |
| scorecards | fcst_model  | The “new” model for the scorecards (i.e. score differences are `scorecards:fcst_model` - `scorecards:ref_model`). | fcst_model: "new_model" | 
| scorecards | parameters  | Which parameters to plot in the scorecards (parameters appear as ordered here). For upper-air variables, if variable “X” is included in the verification, then you can include individual pressure levels in the scorecard plots by using “X750”, etc. . | parameters: <br> - T2m <br> - Td2m <br> - T925 <br> - T700 |
| scorecards | scores      | Which of the deterministic or ensemble summary scores to plot in the scorecard. These appear from left to right in the scorecard. | Deterministic: <br> scores: <br> - "bias" <br> - "rmse" <br> <br> Ensemble: <br> scores: <br> - "mean_bias" <br> - "spread" |
| scorecards | domains     | Construct scorecards for these domains only (provided they exist in `verif:domains`). | domains: <br> - "All" |
| scorecards | pooled_by   | How to pool the data for bootstrapping. See `harpPoint:bootstrap_verify` for more details. | pooled_by: fcst_dttm |
| scorecards | numboot     | Number of bootstrap replicates. See `harpPoint:bootstrap_verify` for more details. Should be “large”. | numboot: 1000 | 
| scorecards | parallel    | Use parallel processing when performing the bootstrapping. | parallel: FALSE | 
| scorecards | num_cores   | Number of cores to use if `parallel=TRUE`. | num_cores: 1 |
| scorecards | plot_signif | As well as the scorecard, plot the actual score difference as a function of leadtime for each parameter and score (provided that `scorecards:create_scrd` is TRUE). Statistical significance of the score difference is also indicated. Uses `fn_plot_signif_diff.R`. | plot_signif: TRUE |
